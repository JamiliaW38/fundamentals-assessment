**We have defined an object variable `myBook` for you, which has 4 properties**


 Using whichever notation you choose (bracket or dot notation), change each value of `myBook` to reflect the following:

* [x ] Title of myBook is "My Autobiography" (string)

* [ x] Cover of myBook is "paperback" (string)

* [ x] myBook has 320 pages (number)

* [x ] It's `true` that I own this book (boolean)

-

* [x ] Using whichever notation, add a property "inStores" and assign it the value `false`

* [x ] Create a proper loop to display each key value pair (property name and property value).
